# CyberDefendr

CyberDefendr is a project designed to develop a AI-based system to detect and prevent malicious cyber-attacks in real-time using Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis. Developed with the programming language Python, CyberDefendr utilizes the libraries Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Networkx to create a powerful system to protect against cyber-attacks. This project is a prototype and is intended to be built upon and extended to become more powerful.

## Introduction

CyberDefendr was created as a prototype for corporations and individuals who want to contribute as I come up with many ideas and may not have the time to work on this specific project everyday. The name CyberDefendr is derived from the words "cyber" and "defender" and is meant to represent the idea that this project is designed to defend against malicious cyber-attacks. 

## Goals

The goal of CyberDefendr is to create a powerful AI-based system to detect and prevent malicious cyber-attacks in real-time using Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis.

## Roadmap

1. Develop an AI-based system to detect malicious cyber-attacks using Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis.
2. Utilize Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Networkx to create a powerful system.
3. Create a prototype that can be built upon and extended to become more powerful.
4. Create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs used.
5. Update the prototype to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well.

## What Could CyberDefendr Become?

CyberDefendr could become a powerful system that is able to detect and prevent malicious cyber-attacks in real-time. With the use of Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis, CyberDefendr could become an invaluable tool for corporations and individuals to protect their data and networks from malicious actors.

## Impressive Things About CyberDefendr

- CyberDefendr utilizes Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis to detect and prevent malicious cyber-attacks.
- CyberDefendr is designed to be built upon and extended to become more powerful.
- CyberDefendr is designed to be user friendly and easy to use.

## Why CyberDefendr Is Unique

CyberDefendr is unique because it utilizes Machine Learning & Network Graph Analysis to detect and prevent malicious cyber-attacks. This combination of technologies is not often seen in other projects, making CyberDefendr a powerful and unique tool.

## Closed Source APIs

The APIs used in CyberDefendr are closed source and a work in progress. They are likely not to be released to the public due to licensing agreements, therefore someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs used.
